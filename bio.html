    <p>here is my biography</p>
    <img src="images/harm van den dorpel.png" style="width: 300px;">
    <p>Harm van den Dorpel, born in 1981 in the Netherlands, is a Berlin-based conceptual artist. His work has been exhibited internationally in Germany, the United States, Italy, United Kingdom and the Netherlands. His broad practice includes the creation of sculpture, collage, computer animation, computer generated graphics and interaction design. Dorpel’s work explores how technology shapes the way systems grow, change, and find meaning. He experiments with all kinds of materials and formats - from drawings and sculptures to digital graphics and custom software. His pieces are always in motion, shaped by feedback loops and algorithms that evolve over time. While his practice connects to the history of “net art,” van den Dorpel also pushes beyond it, creating software that reflects his unique take on artificial intelligence. Blending technical skill with intuition, he builds systems that seem to think on their own - producing surprising, dreamlike visuals that feel both human and computational at once. Essentially, his practice focuses on systems that are ever changing and developing in the context of technology.

“Working within and beyond the origin of ‘net art, the core aspect of the artist’s practice is software development that addresses specific approaches to artificial intelligence.”</p>
